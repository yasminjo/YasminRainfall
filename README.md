# YasminRainfall
This repository contains organised files that were provided in question 3 in the homework of GitHub practical.

This repository contains a comparison of rainfall patterns in Oxford and Melbourne throughout the year.
The data from Melbourne and Oxford was sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology and Met Office. More information on this can be found in the _data-sources.txt_ file in Data.

The structure of my repository: 

- _Data_ contains the raw data and information on the source of these data files.
- _Source_ contains the source code used.
- _Output_ contains the output and results.

To run this analysis use the following command:

_Rscript Source/make-plot.R_

The input data is called _average-rainfall.csv_. This data and the output from running the Rscript can be found in the _Output_ folder.
