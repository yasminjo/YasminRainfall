# YasminRainfall
This repository contains organised files that were provided in question 3 in the homework of GitHub practical.

This repository contains a comparison of rainfall patterns in Oxford and Melbourne throughout the year.
The data from Melbourne and Oxford was sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology and Met Office. More information on this can be found in the data-sources.txt file in Data.

The structure of my repository: 

- Data contains the raw data and information on the source of these data files.
- Source contains the source code used.
- Output contains the output and results.

To run this analysis use the following command:
Rscript Source/make-plot.R
The input data is called average-rainfall.csv. This data and the output from running the Rscript can be found in the Output folder.
